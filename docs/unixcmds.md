Also send                                        an EMail to the user upon                                        completion                at -r 389012.a          cancel the job with ID 389012command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------awk             -Fc -f file                     filename        similar to grep, with the advantage of being able to        find by fields within lines and to process the lines it finds        with further commands. Rather like grep coupled to find and        piped through a math function, like a spreadsheet in function.        e.g.    awk -f seek.schmo poem  uses the file of awk commands                                        called 'seek.schmo' and applies                                        them to 'poem'.                awk '/breath/ {print $0}' poem                                        finds lines in the file 'poem'                                        with the string 'breath' and                                        displays them on the terminal.                                        Note: {print $0} is default                                        action                awk -F\  '$1~/breath/ {print $1, $2}' poem                                        finds lines in the file 'poem'                                        with the first word (seen as a                                        field with a space delimiter)                                        containing the string 'breath'                                        and displays the first and                                        second words (fields)                awk '$3!~/nausea/ {print $2, $1, $6}' illness                                        finds lines in the file                                        'illness' with the third field                                        NOT containing 'nausea' and then                                        displays fields 2, 1, and 6, in                                        that order                awk -F: '$1~/item/ {tn=$3+$4+$5;tv=tn*$6;print $2, tn, tv}\                        inventory                                        finds lines that list items                                        from the file 'inventory'. The                                        itemID ($2) is printed, as is the                                        total number of items in the                                        three warehouses ($3+$4+$5) and                                        the total value of these items                                        (tn*$6, where $6 is the item unit                                        cost). Notes: field delimiter                                        is full colon; semi-colon is used                                        to separate the three actions                awk 'END {print NR}' poem                                        goes to the end of the file                                        'poem' and prints out the total                                        number of lines. NR = Number of                                        Records, and is built in to AWK.                awk '$3 >= 15 {print $0}' inventory                                        finds the records with the                                        third field GE 15 and prints                                        them. Conditional pattern                                        selection.                awk '$1~/[A-F]*/&& $3 <= 150 {nd=150-$3;print "warehouse \                        3 needs " nd " more of " $1}' inventory                                        finds the items beginning with                                        A through F and assesses the                                        stock requirements of warehouse                                        #3 for these items. && means                                        BOTH conditions must be met.        awk also has the following control commands for action statements:                if ( conditional ) statement [ else statement ]                while ( conditional ) statement                for ( expression ; conditional ; expression) statement                break                continue                { [ statement ] ...}                variable=expression                print [ expression-list ] [ > expression ]                Sprintf format [ , expression-list ] [ > expression ]                next    skip remaining patterns on  this input line                exit    skip the rest of the inputcommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------cal             -                               [month] year        show a calendar for a particular month or year        e.g.    cal 05 1873command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------cancel          -                               job ID from lp        stops a printing job.        e.g.    cancel 96               stops printing job ID 96command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------cat             -                               filename(s)        dump contents of file(s) to screen        e.g.    cat Personal/form.txtcommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------cc              -c,o                            filename(s).c (or .o)        compiles c programme(s) contained in 'filename.c(or .o)', and        generates an executable file, usually called a.out        e.g.    cc -o works yes.c it.c  compiles 'yes.c' and 'it.c' into                                        an executable file named 'works'command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------cd              -                               Dirname        change to another directory        e.g.    cd Pictures                cd ../libcommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------chmod           ugo,+/-,rwx                     filename(s)        changes the protection and/or mode of operation of a file        e.g.    chmod u+x test          makes the file 'test' into an                                        executable one within a shell                                        for the user                chmod go-rw poem        removes permission for the                                        group or the world to read or                                        write the file 'poem'                chmod o-rwx Poems       no one outside you or the group                                        may read files in, write files to,                                        or even list the files in the your                                        Poems sub-directory                chmod o-x,g+w script    others can't execute your file                                        'script', but your group can write                                        to itcommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------cmp             -l                              file1 file2        compares the two files and reports the location of the first        difference found between them        e.g.    cmp poem poem1                cmp -l poem poem1       shows all differences                cmp poem                shows first difference between                                        what you enter and file 'poem'command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------comm            -1,2,3                          file1 file2        compares the two files, but only if they have been sorted        first, and shows results in a three column table. Col1 lists        lines only in file1, col2 for file2, and col3 for lines in common.        e.g.    comm -12 poem poem1     show only lines in common (col3)command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------cp              -                               filename(s) newfilename                                                filename(s) Dirname        copy file(s) into another filename or directory        e.g.    cp 1st 2nd composite    puts contents of '1st' and                                        '2nd' into the 'composite' file                cp assorted Misc        copies 'assorted' into the                                        'Misc' subdirectorycommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------csh             -                               -        make a c shell; exit with ^Dcommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------cut             -c,f -d                         filename(s)        cuts columns from a file and passes them along.

Delimiters may be        specified other than  and many delimiters may be cycled        through as the merge proceeds.        e.g.    paste poem1 poem2       appends each line of poem2 onto                                        the end of each line of poem1,                                        delimited by a                 paste -s -d" \t\n" report                                        takes the lines of 'report' in                                        threes, separating the first                                        two by , the second two                                        by  and ending the third                                        with a  (aka CRLF)        command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------pg              -c,s,???

The 'q' command quits pg.        e.g.    pg text                 shows the contents of 'text'                                        one page at a timecommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------pr              -a,d,f,ln,m,n,p,r,t,wn,+n               filename(s)        formats file(s) for display to terminal or piping to printer        -a      multicolumn output, by line across page (with -n option)        -d      doublespaced        -f      use formfeed to separate pages; doesn't affect page length        -ln     make page length n lines, instead of 66        -m      print all files at once, one per column        -n      output in n columns, by line down the page        -p      pause before the beginning of each page        -r      do not show diagnostic report if error occurs        -t      omit 5 line header and footer        -wn     set page width to n characters, instead of 72        +n      start with nth page        e.g.    pr -dp poem             show 'poem' on screen, double-                                        spaced and requiring a RETURN                                        before showing next pagecommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------ps              -a,f                            -        display the process status, which shows the process ID numbers        of jobs in the system, the types of jobs and from where they        are being run        e.g.    ps -a                   show ALL processes from all users                ps -f                   show ALL information about the                                        users' jobs, including prioritycommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------pwd             -                               -        show the name of the present working directorycommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------rm              -i,r                            [Dirname/]filename(s)        removes the named file(s)        e.g.    rm -i Janu*.*           deletes all files starting with                                        'Janu' and with only one extension,                                        with a query for each file                rm -r Old               deletes the directory 'Old' and                                        every file within it!command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------rmdir           -                               Dirname(s)        removes the named directory(s) IFF empty        e.g.    rmdir Oldstuff          deletes 'Oldstuff' if it has no                                        filescommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------sed             -n 'ed command'                 filename(s)        edits file(s) as though it was (they were) a stream of text,        dumping output elsewhere (screen or another file) instead of        modifying the original file. Great for global changes and for        specific changes IFF you know which lines (by number or by        pattern) need to be altered. Use sed under sh, not csh!        An 'ed command' has the following structure:        '(number(,range)OR(,/pattern/)command(/old/new/)(\insert)'        This is a complicated structure and needs clarification.        The first part of an 'ed command' tells sed where to apply the        changes: to a line or lines matching numbers or patterns, to a        mix of the two, or globally.        e.g.    sed '2d' poem           deletes second line of 'poem'                sed '2,4 s/tree/timber/' poem                                        replaces the FIRST occurance of                                        the word 'tree' with the word                                        'timber' in lines 2 through 4                                        of 'poem'                sed '7,/Linus/p' poem   prints every line from the                                        seventh to the first with the                                        word 'Linus'                sed 's/[Hh]emo/[Hh]aemo/g' poem                                        in ALL lines of 'poem', change                                        EVERY occurance of 'hemo' or                                        'Hemo' to 'haemo' or 'Haemo'                                        (g = global)                sed -n '$p' poem        prints the last line of 'poem'                sed -n '/c[ao]n/p' poem prints only lines with 'can' or                                        'con' in them                sed -n '/c[^ao]n/p' poem                                        prints only lines with words                                        containing 'c?n', where ? isn't                                        either a or o; omits 'can I go                                        for a walk?' but includes 'can                                        I go to Cincinatti for a walk?'                sed -n '/c[ao]n/!p' poem                                        prints only lines WITHOUT 'can'                                        or 'con' in them        The second part of an 'ed command' tells sed what changes to        apply. Note that some of these change commands will not accept        a range of lines (e.g., 2,6) for their action.        e.g.    sed 'a\                > append THIS!' poem    puts the phrase 'append THIS!'                                        on its own line after EVERY                                        line in the file 'poem'                sed '/opt/ i\                > insert THIS!' poem    puts the phrase 'insert THIS!'                                        on its own line before every                                        line containing the word 'opt'                sed '/You/ c\                > Yo Mama' insults                                        changes all lines with the word                                        'You' into the phrase shown                sed '/boots/ s/military/army/g' insults                                        changes the word 'army' to                                        'military' whenever 'boots' is in                                        a line of the file 'insults'                sed -n '3p' poem        prints the third line of 'poem'                sed '/nausea/q' ill     prints the file 'ill' up to the                                        first occurance of 'nausea'                sed '$ r finish' poem   appends the contents of the file                                        'finish' to the file 'poem'                sed '/[aeio]/ !w uvowel.ls' poem                                        copies every line from 'poem'                                        lacking the letters [aeio] and                                        puts them in a file called                                        'uvowel.ls'                sed '=' poem            prints the line numbers for                                        each line of 'poem'                sed '/tart/=' poem      prints the line numbers of each                                        line with the word 'tart' in 'poem'                sed '/don\'t/!p' poem   prints all lines without the                                        word 'don't' from 'poem'        Finally, sed commands may be multiple; concatenate them by        enclosing them within one set of '', but on separate lines.command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------sh              -                               -        makes a Bourne shell; exit with ^Dcommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------sort            -b,d,f,n,o filename,r -tc,+sw -ew[cf]   filename(s)        sorts and merges lines from file(s). Resulting list is alpha-        betical, but UPPER and lower case letters are sorted separately,        numbers are sorted by first digit (not value), blanks beginning        lines come before A or a in listing, and other symbol characters        are used in sorting as well. These defaults can be over-ridden        and lines may also be sorted by strings other than the first        one, by using the fields option.        e.g.    sort -b poem            sort 'poem', ignoring blanks                sort -d poem            sort 'poem' using ONLY letters,                                        numbers and blanks                sort -f poem            sort 'poem' ignoring letter case                sort -n inventory       sort 'inventory' by number value                sort -o surpoem poem    sort 'poem' and put result into                                        a newfile called 'surpoem'                sort -r poem            sort 'poem' in reverse order                sort -t: -f -o invsort +1 -3 inventory                                        sort 'inventory' using only the                                        second and third words on each                                        line.

Default number is -10l.        e.g.    tail poem               shows last ten lines of 'poem'                tail +30c poem          shows all of 'poem' beginning                                        with thirtieth charactercommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------tee             -a,i                            filename(s)        forks output to both the screen and a named file        e.g.    ls | tee save.ls        sends list of files to screen                                        and to file 'save.ls'command         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------time            -                               command        runs the command indicated and reports on the time used.

Repeated lines must be adjacent (so sort first!)        e.g.    uniq -c poem            shows all lines, with number of                                        repeats counted                uniq -d poem            shows only duplicated lines                uniq -u poem            shows only unique lines in infilecommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------wc              -l,w,c                          filename(s)        counts the number of characters, words and lines in a file        e.g.    wc poem                 shows three numbers for # chars,                                        words and lines + filename                wc -l poem              shows only # lines + filenamecommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------who             -                               [ami] [ am i]        tells who is using the system, and who YOU might be        e.g.    who                     shows all current users                whoami                  shows your userID                who am I                shows your userID + stuffcommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------write           -                               userID        sends lines from your terminal to the terminal of another user        e.g.    write norbert           lets me fill Norbert's screen with                                        my blathercommand         options                         argument-------         -------                         --------zip             - h,i,r                         filename(s)        shrinks or (unzip) expands files, between their usable forms        (i.e., editable, executable, viewable, etc.) and a much smaller        format for transfer or storage        e.g.    zip mbf mybigfile.txt   shrinks the file 'mybigfile.txt'                                        to one called 'mbf.zip'                zip -h                  writes a short help file on zip                                        to the screen                zip allst -i allstuff.* makes a compressed archive called                                        'allst.zip' of all files beginning                                        with 'allstuff', regardless of                                        the file extensions                zip -r megadir .        makes a compressed archive called                                        'megadir' of the current directory                                        and all its subdirectories                                                       unzip mbf.zip           expands 'mbf.zip' back to                                        'mybigfile.txt' againSpecial features------- --------Wild cards      ?                       matches any one character                *                       matches any number of characters                [co]*.c                 matches c programme files                                        beginning with 'c' or 'o'                [a-q]*                  matches files beginning with                                        any letter from a through to qJob control&               put job/process followed by '&' into backgroundat              tell a job/process when to runkill            terminates a specified job/processnohup           make job/process permanent, even if user logs out;                should be used with '&', so log out is possible!Redirection methods>               sends output to a file instead of the screen>>              appends output to a file instead of the screen<               receive input from a file|               "pipeline" send output from one command to another commandtee             fork output to screen and to named fileContinuation methods;               command separator - for consecutive commands on one line\               command line linker - to continue command on next line#               line nulifier - text following is treated only as textValue/content recall methods$variable       return value of variable`command`       return contents of command outputneutralising METAcharacters * ?
